abstract = {The Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS) is designed to perform follow-up observations of transient
astronomical sources at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths (0.9 - 2.4 microns). In particular, RIMAS will be used to
perform photometric and spectroscopic observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows to compliment the <i>Swift</i>
satellite’s science goals. Upon completion, RIMAS will be installed on Lowell Observatory’s 4.3 meter Discovery
Channel Telescope (DCT) located in Happy Jack, Arizona. The instrument’s optical design includes a collimator lens
assembly, a dichroic to divide the wavelength coverage into two optical arms (0.9 - 1.4 microns and 1.4 - 2.4 microns
respectively), and a camera lens assembly for each optical arm. Because the wavelength coverage extends out to 2.4
microns, all optical elements are cooled to ~70 K. Filters and transmission gratings are located on wheels prior to each
camera allowing the instrument to be quickly configured for photometry or spectroscopy. An athermal optomechanical
design is being implemented to prevent lenses from loosing their room temperature alignment as the system is cooled.
The thermal expansion of materials used in this design have been measured in the lab. Additionally, RIMAS has a guide
camera consisting of four lenses to aid observers in passing light from target sources through spectroscopic slits. Efforts
to align these optics are ongoing.},
