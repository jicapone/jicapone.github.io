**Cross-dispersion setup for an integrated near-IR astrophotonic spectrograph**  
*Harsha Pradeep, Pradip Gatkine, Sylvain Veilleux, Yang Zhang, John I. Capone, Mario Dagenais, et al.*

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present the design and implementation of a cross-disperser module for an integrated near-infrared astrophotonic spectrograph. This photonic spectrograph disperses light with on-chip waveguide gratings, and our cross-dispersion setup uses free-space optics to separate overlapping spectral orders. We describe the optical layout and components of the cross-disperser, and we report initial test results demonstrating its performance in resolving adjacent orders. This development is a step toward fully integrated photonic spectrographs for astronomy.

HARMONI is the first-light adaptive optics assisted integral field spectrograph for ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. We report on a prototyping campaign to test the alignment procedure for HARMONI’s three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) collimator. A full-scale dummy TMA was constructed, and we developed an iterative optical alignment method using a laser tracker and camera metrology. The prototype tests verified that the TMA alignment can consistently converge within the tight tolerances required, validating the alignment plan for the actual HARMONI spectrograph.

The successful 2020 launch and 2021 landing of NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover initiated the first phase of the NASA/ESA Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign. MSR’s goal is to collect samples from Mars and return them to Earth. The campaign involves the Perseverance rover, a Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL), and an Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). On the ERO is the Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS), which will capture and process orbiting sample containers launched from Mars. We have designed a vision system to determine the capture orientation of the Orbiting Sample (OS) in the CCRS. The system consists of two visible-light cameras and two LED illumination modules. Lab tests and optical simulations predict that, using a single image transmitted from Mars orbit, the vision system can correctly identify the OS post-capture orientation:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

We report absolute refractive index measurements for three optical glasses (Ohara S-FPL55, S-LAL8, and S-BAH28) used in the visible channel of the ELT HARMONI spectrograph camera:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. Measurements were performed with the CHARMS cryogenic refractometer at NASA Goddard over wavelengths 450–2500 nm and temperatures 105–310 K:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. These data provide the dispersion and thermo-optic coefficients for the glasses at cryogenic temperature, enabling accurate modeling of HARMONI’s optics at operating temperature. The results will ensure the spectrograph achieves the required imaging performance across its wavelength range.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present an end-to-end optical model of the HARMONI integral field spectrograph to predict its as-built performance. The model incorporates measured fabrication errors and alignment tolerances for all optics. By Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate image quality and throughput degradation due to manufacturing and alignment defects. Our analysis shows that even with realistic surface figure errors and misalignments, the instrument will meet its performance requirements. This modeling approach guides final alignment procedures and provides confidence that HARMONI’s delivered performance will closely match predictions.

We present the final opto-mechanical design of the four HARMONI spectrographs and outline the assembly, integration, and verification (AIV) plan for these units. Each spectrograph includes a transmissive collimator and camera operating at 140 K, and a suite of diffraction gratings. We describe design optimizations made since the preliminary design, including improved mounting of large optics and refined alignment fiducials. We then detail the step-by-step assembly procedures and specialized metrology tools for aligning mirror assemblies to meet strict image quality requirements. The AIV plan is structured to validate optical performance at multiple stages. Together, the final design and AIV strategy ensure that the HARMONI spectrographs can be built and aligned to deliver the required on-sky performance.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

HARMONI is a visible and near-infrared integral field spectrograph for the ELT. We report its final design and present quantitative predictions of its on-sky performance. The instrument features four identical spectrographs feeding a mosaic of detectors, with resolutions $R\sim3000$–17,000. We summarize final design optimizations in the optics, mechanics, and cryogenics since the preliminary design. Based on end-to-end models, we predict HARMONI’s imaging quality, throughput, and sensitivity for representative observing modes. In nominal seeing and with adaptive optics, HARMONI will achieve diffraction-limited performance in the H-band. The expected $5\sigma$ continuum sensitivity in 5 hr reaches $\sim25$ AB mag in $H$-band at $R=3500$. We also present simulated data to illustrate HARMONI’s capabilities for spatially resolved spectroscopy. These performance predictions will be validated during integration and commissioning.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

The Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS) is designed for fast near-IR follow-up of transients (e.g. GRBs). We present the testing and characterization of RIMAS’s spectral elements. In particular, we measured the efficiency and dispersion of custom diamond-turned ZnSe transmission grisms at cryogenic temperature. Multiple grism configurations were evaluated to quantify throughput and wavelength calibration accuracy. Our tests demonstrate that the grisms meet design specifications, with throughput exceeding 70% in-band and spectral resolution matching predictions. These results validate the spectral performance of RIMAS and inform its operation for time-domain astronomy.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We developed a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the alignment process for HARMONI’s three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) relay. Using a laser tracker and a focal-plane detector in the simulation, we iteratively adjust mirror positions to minimize wavefront error. The simulation was run 1000 times with random initial misalignments within tolerance. Nearly all trials (≥99%) converged to meet image quality requirements after two iterations of adjustments:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. This indicates the planned TMA alignment strategy is robust. The simulation results have been used to refine the alignment procedure for HARMONI, ensuring efficient integration and verification of the actual hardware.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

HARMONI’s four spectrographs each use 11 large transmission gratings, which must be cooled to ~140 K. The grating is the single largest throughput loss element in any configuration. Furthermore, manufacturers cannot easily measure long-wave efficiency at 140 K. We developed a metrology setup to measure diffraction grating efficiency across HARMONI’s 0.47–2.45 μm bandpass at operating temperature. The setup uses a modulated dual-beam spectrophotometric method with a lock-in amplifier to minimize systematic error:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. We also outline a method to measure stray light due to scattering and grating defects. We present initial efficiency measurements for prototype gratings, demonstrating >70% first-order efficiency over 80% of each band (meeting specifications) and characterizing wavelength-dependent stray light levels.

We provide an overview of the design and status of the four identical spectrographs of HARMONI, the ELT’s first-light integral field spectrograph. Each spectrograph covers 0.47–2.45 μm and comprises a cryogenic TMA collimator, a suite of dispersive elements, and a camera. We discuss key design choices (e.g., transmission gratings vs. VPH gratings), opto-mechanical layouts, and the approach to thermal control at 140 K. We also present anticipated performance (spot sizes, throughput) from the final optical model. Finally, we describe ongoing prototyping efforts for critical components and outline the integration plan for delivering the spectrographs in time for ELT first light.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present the assembly of an engineering model for one of HARMONI’s four spectrographs to de-risk the manufacturing and alignment processes. The engineering model uses non-optical dummy components with identical interfaces and tolerances as the flight units. We describe the custom jigs and metrology employed to position mirrors and gratings with micron-level accuracy. Key challenges included aligning the cryogenic TMA collimator and camera off-axis mirrors. Through this dry-run assembly, we validated alignment procedures and identified minor design adjustments to ease integration. The successful completion of the spectrograph engineering model gives confidence in the build process for the final science spectrographs.

We fit an afterglow model and find a significant positive residual, matching the behavior of SN 1998bw in optical filters. We interpret this as the photometric signature of supernova SN 2013cq associated with the GRB.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present a sample of 45 damped Lyα system (DLA) counterparts (33 detections and 12 upper limits) which host gamma-ray bursts (GRB-DLAs), in order to investigate star formation and metallicity in DLA-hosting galaxies. Our sample spans a wide redshift range and is nearly three times larger than previous DLA counterpart surveys based on quasar sight-lines. We derive star formation rates (SFRs) from rest-frame UV photometry and SED modeling. We find that the DLA host SFRs show no correlation with redshift or H I column density. Using HST and ground-based data, we examine the star formation efficiency in these GRB-DLA hosts. We find that our GRB-DLA hosts span both higher-efficiency and lower-efficiency star formation regimes compared to local galaxies. Their gas depletion times also vary widely, with some systems showing under-abundance and others over-abundance of metals, suggesting episodic star formation with bursts and quiescent periods likely due to feedback and/or inflow/outflow cycles:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We report on our observing campaign for GRB 140903A, a nearby ($z=0.351$) short-duration ($T_{90}\sim0.3$ s) gamma-ray burst. X-ray monitoring up to 21 days after the burst revealed a steep decline in flux about one day post-burst. Coordinated optical and radio observations showed a similar sharp break at the same time, which we interpret as evidence of a narrowly collimated jet. Modeling the afterglow with a standard fireball model yields a jet opening angle of ~5°, and a beaming-corrected total energy of $\sim2\times10^{50}$ erg. We discuss the implications for the nature of the GRB progenitor. Several lines of evidence – the prompt gamma-ray properties, the old and low star-forming host galaxy, and the lack of a bright supernova – point to a compact binary merger origin for this event:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present the laboratory characterization of a Teledyne H2RG infrared detector for the Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS). The H2RG is tested under RIMAS’s expected operating conditions (100 K, slow readout). We measure key performance parameters: read noise ($\sim12$ e$^-$ rms), dark current ($<0.01$ e$^-$/pix/s at 100 K), linearity, and quantum efficiency (QE). We find the detector’s QE exceeds 80% from 1–2.4 μm, supporting high throughput. We also describe the optical coupling of the detector in RIMAS and estimate the total instrument throughput, which is about 35% in $H$-band including the detector. These results inform exposure time estimates and confirm the suitability of the H2RG for RIMAS’s science goals.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We describe a manufacturing process to produce large ZnSe transmission grisms for the RIMAS instrument. Each grism is a prism with a ruled diffraction grating on one face, designed to disperse near-IR light while operating at cryogenic temperature. Using single-point diamond machining, we ruled coarse (100 μm period) gratings on 150 mm aperture ZnSe substrates. We achieved surface roughness $<10$ nm and groove depth uniformity within 2%, yielding diffraction efficiency >85% in 1st order. We present the metrology of grating groove profile and optical performance measurements at 80 K. These diamond-machined ZnSe grisms meet RIMAS’s spectral resolution and throughput requirements and demonstrate a viable method for fabricating large cryogenic gratings.

We present optical and near-infrared light curves and spectra of SN 2013dx, which was associated with the nearby ($z=0.145$) GRB 130702A. The prompt gamma-ray energy release of GRB 130702A ($E_{\gamma,iso} \sim 6.4\times10^{50}$ erg) is intermediate between low-luminosity GRBs like GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and the broader cosmological GRB population. The $g'r'i'z'$ light curves of SN 2013dx evolve ~20% faster than those of SN 1998bw, with a comparable peak luminosity. Spectroscopically, SN 2013dx closely resembles other broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (both those associated with GRBs and those without GRBs) with an expansion velocity around 21,000 km/s at peak light. We construct a quasi-bolometric light curve (extending into the NIR) for SN 2013dx – only the fifth GRB-SN with extensive NIR coverage – and derive basic explosion parameters using simple models. We estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.37\pm0.01 M_\odot$, an ejecta mass of $3.1\pm0.1 M_\odot$, and a kinetic energy of $8.2\pm0.4 \times10^{51}$ erg. These values are consistent with previous GRB-associated supernovae. Moreover, across the broader population of GRB-SNe, we find no correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass and GRB energy, despite expectations that more asymmetric explosions synthesize more $^{56}$Ni – however, we do find that $^{56}$Ni mass correlates with the supernova’s kinetic energy:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present an extensive observational campaign on the Swift-discovered GRB 141121A, which occurred almost a decade after Swift’s launch (hence “Happy Birthday Swift”). Our observations cover radio to X-ray wavelengths and extend over 30 days post-burst. The prompt gamma-ray emission lasted 1410 s, placing GRB 141121A in the class of ultra-long GRBs. At redshift $z=1.469$, the burst’s isotropic energy is $E_{\gamma,iso} \approx 8.0 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Notable features of this burst include (1) a flat early-time optical light curve and (2) a re-brightening across radio to X-ray around 3 days post-burst. After this bump, a steep optical-to-X-ray decay sets in, while the radio fades much more slowly. We interpret the data using the standard forward+reverse shock model, disentangling the two contributions. The peculiar early optical behavior (during $t \lesssim 3$ days) may require a two-component jet model. Overall, GRB 141121A and similar ultra-long GRBs provide an excellent opportunity to study the dominant radiation mechanisms in powerful GRB explosions. Future missions (e.g. SVOM, Einstein Probe, ISS-Lobster) are expected to detect many more events of this class:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

We present the optical design of the Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS), a dual-channel ($0.9$–2.5 μm) instrument combining imaging and spectroscopic modes at cryogenic temperature (77 K). The RIMAS optics include a fold mirror system feeding two cameras and a removable grism for spectroscopy. We discuss the selection of infrared materials (CaF$_2$, ZnSe) and coatings to ensure high throughput across the YJHK bands. We analyze the thermal contraction of optical mounts and its effect on focus – finite element analysis was used to design flexures maintaining alignment from room temperature to 77 K. Predicted image quality shows diffraction-limited performance in $H$-band. We also describe the cryostat layout and anticipated instrument throughput (~50% including detector). These cryogenic optical design solutions enable RIMAS to achieve its science requirements for rapid IR transient follow-up.

We report early development of the Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS), focusing on its cryogenic optical subsystem. RIMAS is designed for imaging and spectroscopy from 0.9–2.5 μm with fast response to transient targets. We discuss trade-offs in the optical design, including the choice of a reflective collimator for broad wavelength correction and the use of cold stops to control thermal background. Preliminary analysis of optical tolerances indicates alignment must be maintained within ~50 μm to preserve image quality at 1 μm. We also outline initial test results of a small-scale prototype demonstrating the viability of the proposed optical layout at cryogenic temperature. These analyses guided the final design presented in our subsequent 2014 report.
