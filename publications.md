<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

Here we present an optical cross-dispersion setup for an astrophotonic spectrograph in the near-IR H-band (1460 to 1630nm). In this spectrograph, the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) chip acts as the main dispersing element. An AWG produces a 1D spectrum with overlapping spectral orders, and we designed a cross-dispersion setup that can cross-disperse these overlapping spectral orders perpendicular to the 1D spectral output. This setup consists of a collimating lens, a grating, and a focusing lens. The cross-dispersed 2D spectrum is then imaged onto a near-IR detector array. The AWG we used for this project has a spectral resolution of (λ/δλ) of ∼1000 and a free spectral range of 10nm. An on-sky solar test was performed and analyzed, demonstrating the potential of this setup.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

HARMONI is the first light, adaptive optics assisted, visible and near-infrared integral field spectrograph for the European Southern Observatory’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). It covers a large spectral range from 450 nm to 2450 nm with spectral resolving powers R ≡ λ/δλ from 3300 to 17000 and spatial sampling from 60 mas to 4 mas. It contains four identical spectrograph modules that collimate, disperse, and image the long slit at the exit of the integral field unit onto the science detectors. The collimation optics comprises of a three mirror anastigmat, using off-axis, aspheric mirrors. Previously we simulated an iterative alignment procedure that uses interferometric wavefront measurements together with a numerical optical model to minimise the wavefront error by adjusting a set of compensators. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure with an off-axis parabolic mirror as a prototype collimator, that has the same number of compensators as the HARMONI collimators. We show that we achieve a sufficiently low wavefront error within a few iterations of alignment. We cooled the test setup in a cryostat and obtained preliminary wavefront measurements at a cryogenic temperature of 130 ˚K, demonstrating the athermal design of the prototype.

The successful 2020 launch and 2021 landing of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Perseverance Mars rover initiated the first phase of the NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign. The goal of the MSR campaign is to collect scientifically interesting samples from the Martian surface and return them to Earth for further study in terrestrial laboratories. The MSR campaign consists of three major spacecraft components to accomplish this objective: the Perseverance Mars rover, the Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) and the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). Onboard the ERO spacecraft is the Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS). CCRS will capture, process and return to Earth the samples that have been collected after they are launched into Mars orbit by the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), which is delivered to Mars onboard the SRL. To facilitate the processing of the orbiting sample (OS) via the CCRS, we have designed and developed a vision system to determine the OS capture orientation. The vision system is composed of two cameras sensitive to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and two illumination modules constructed from broadband light emitting diodes (LED). Vision system laboratory tests and physics-based optical simulations predict CCRS ground processing will be able to correctly identify the OS post-capture orientation using only a single vision system image that is transmitted to Earth from Mars orbit.

This paper reports on absolute refractive index measurements for the S-FPL55, S-LAL8, and S-BAH28 glass materials that are used in the visible channel of the HARMONI integral field spectrograph of the Extreme Large Telescope (ELT). These measurements were carried out by using the world-class Cryogenic High Accuracy Refraction Measurement System (CHARMS) refractometer (located at the Goddard Space Flight Center) in the 0.420−3.5 μm wavelength range and in the cryogenic temperature range of 105−310K. We also report on the validity of a cold-lens system design that is based on extrapolated 300 K refractive index data in comparison with directly measured cryogenic data obtained with the CHARMS refractometer.

HARMONI, an adaptive optics (AO) assisted integral field spectrograph (IFS), will be the core spectroscopic capability for the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO’s) Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). It will support several AO modes and achieve diffraction-limited (≈10 mas) to seeing-limited spatial resolution, at low to high spectral resolving powers (λ/Δλ = 3,000-18,000) spanning the visible to near-infrared wavelength range (0.46-2.45 μm). In this paper we describe the modelling of the entire optical science path, from the creation of the end-to-end optical model, over how we analyse the optical performance, to the preliminary results of both nominal and as-built Monte-Carlo instances of HARMONI.

HARMONI is the first light visible and near-IR integral field spectrograph for the ELT. It covers a large spectral range from 450nm to 2450nm with resolving powers from R (≡λ/Δλ) 3500 to 18000 and spatial sampling from 60mas to 4mas. It can operate in two Adaptive Optics modes - SCAO (including a High Contrast capability) and LTAO - or with NOAO. The project is preparing for Final Design Reviews. The instrument uses a field splitter and image slicer to divide the field into 4 sub-units, each providing an input slit to one of four nearly identical spectrographs. This proceeding presents the final opto- mechanical design and the AIV plan of the spectrograph units.

The Rapid infrared IMAger Spectrometer (RIMAS) is designed to quickly follow-up near-infrared (NIR) transient events, gamma ray bursts in particular. One way RIMAS will accomplish this mission is with its echelle spectrograph (R≈4000) that contain the first ruled grisms to be used in cross-dispersed mode for NIR astronomy. These ZnSe grisms were recently fabricated at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. This paper discusses the testing and categorization of the echelle spectrographs containing these grisms by comparing the modeled spectra to experimental spectra. This testing resulted in verification of the echelle spectrograph's quality, resolution, and dispersion. Efforts to develop a data reduction pipeline and upgrade RIMAS's detectors are ongoing.

HARMONI is the first light visible and near-infrared (450 – 2450 nm, λ/Δλ = 3,000 – 17,000) integral field spectrograph for the European Southern Observatory’s Extremely Large Telescope. The path for scientific light includes pre-optics to set the field of view (4 – 60 mas), an integral field unit to reformat the rectangular field into four 540 mm long slits, and four spectrographs which collimate, disperse, and image the light. The spectrographs collimate the input slits using a system of three off-axis, aspheric mirrors which lack a common optical axis. We have demonstrated the alignment procedure of this three-mirror anastigmat in numerical simulations. We will initially align the collimator mirrors by measuring reference features with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). We will then use an interferometer to measure the wavefront error (WFE) at positions along the input slit. These WFE measurements will be entered into a numerical model to optimize available compensators, and the corresponding adjustments will be applied to the collimator. This process of measuring WFE, using a model to determine optimal compensator adjustments, and applying the adjustments will be repeated until the performance has converged. As an initial demonstration of this method, we have simulated the full alignment procedure. The modelled systems include manufacturing errors, account for the uncertainty of values reported by mirror manufacturers, and simulate the CMM and interferometer alignment steps. Nearly all of 1000 instances meet our requirements after two iterations of the optical alignment, and all were found to satisfy our requirements after five iterations.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

The High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral field spectrograph (HARMONI) will be one of the instruments installed on ESO's 39-meter Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) at first light. The instrument will operate from 0.47 - 2.45 μm with Δλ/λ = 3,000 - 17,000. On-sky spatial pixels (spaxels) are divided between four spectrographs, each equipped with 11 transmission diffraction gratings to cover the ranges of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. These spectrographs will be cooled to ~140 K to decrease thermal radiation at longer wavelengths.
In all configurations, the diffraction grating will lose a greater fraction of scientific light than any other single optic in the instrument. Additionally, manufacturers are often unable to measure the fraction of transmitted light at HARMONI's longest wavelengths. For these reasons, we have developed a setup to measure the efficiencies of transmission diffraction gratings across HARMONI's bandpass. The setup uses modulated signals, a single detector, and a lock-in amplifier to minimize sources of systematic errors. A modified version of this setup may be used to measure stray light. These setups and initial results are presented.

HARMONI is an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) for ESO’s ELT. It has been selected as the first light spec- trograph and will provide the workhorse spectroscopic capabilities for the ELT for many years. HARMONI is currently at the PDR-level and the current design for the HARMONI IFS consists of a number of spaxel scales sampling down to the diffraction limit of the telescope. It uses a field splitter and image slicer to divide the field into 4 sub-units, each providing an input slit to one of four nearly identical spectrographs. All spectrographs will operate at near infrared wavelengths (0.81-2.45 micrometers), sampling different parts of the spectrum with a range of spectral resolving powers (3300, 7000, 18000). In addition, two of the four spectrographs will have a Visible capability (0.5-0.83 micrometers) operating with seeing-limited observations. This proceeding presents an overview of the opto-mechanical design and specifications of the spectrograph units for HARMONI.

HARMONI (High Angular Resolution MOnolithic Integral field spectrograph)1 is a planned first-light integral field spectrograph for the Extremely Large Telescope. The spectrograph sub-system is being designed, developed, and built by the University of Oxford. The project has just completed the Preliminary Design Review (PDR), with all major systems having nearly reached a final conceptual design. As part of the overall prototyping and assembly, integration, and testing (AIT) of the HARMONI spectrograph, we will be building a full-scale engineering model of the spectrograph. This will include all of the moving and mechanical systems, but without optics. Its main purpose is to confirm the AIT tasks before the availability of the optics, and the system will be tested at HARMONI cryogenic temperatures. By the time of the construction of the engineering model, all of the individual modules and mechanisms of the spectrograph will have been prototyped and cryogenically tested. The lessons learned from the engineering model will then be fed back into the overall design of the spectrograph modules ahead of their development.

We observed the afterglow of GRB 130427A with the Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR) instrument on the 1.5 m Harold L. Johnson telescope of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in Sierra San Pedro Mártir. Our homogenous griZY JH photometry extends from the night of the burst to three years later. We fit a model for the afterglow. There is a significant positive residual that matches the behavior of SN 1998bw in the griZ filters; we suggest that this is a photometric signature of the supernova SN 2013cq associated with the Gamma-ray burst. The peak absolute magnitude of the supernova is M_r = -18.43 +- 0.11.

We present a sample of 45 Damped Lyα system (DLA; N_HI >= 2 x 1e20 cm^-2) counterparts (33 detections, 12 upper limits) which host gamma-ray bursts (GRB-DLAs) in order to investigate star formation and metallicity within galaxies hosting DLAs. Our sample spans z ~ 2--6 and is nearly three times larger than any previously detected DLA counterparts survey based on quasar line-of-sight searches (QSO-DLAs). We report star formation rates (SFRs) from rest-frame UV photometry and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that DLA counterpart SFRs are not correlated with either redshift or H i column density. Thanks to the combination of Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations, we also investigate DLA host star formation efficiency. Our GRB-DLA counterpart sample spans both higher efficiency and low efficiency star formation regions compared to the local Kennicutt–Schmidt relation, local star formation laws, and z ~ 3 cosmological simulations. We also compare the depletion times of our DLA hosts sample to other objects in the local universe; our sample appears to deviate from the star formation efficiencies measured in local spiral and dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find similar efficiencies as local inner disks, SMC, and Lyman-break galaxy outskirts. Finally, our enrichment time measurements show a spread of systems with under- and over-abundance of metals, which may suggest that these systems had episodic star formation and a metal enrichment/depletion as a result of strong stellar feedback and/or metal inflow/outflow.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We report the results of our observing campaign on GRB 140903A, a nearby (z = 0.351) short-duration (T90 ∼ 0.3 s) gamma-ray burst discovered by Swift. We monitored the X-ray afterglow with Chandra up to 15 days after the burst and detected a steeper decay of the X-ray flux after tj ≈ 1 day. Continued monitoring at optical and radio wavelengths showed a similar decay in flux at nearly the same time, and we interpret it as evidence of a narrowly collimated jet. By using the standard fireball model to describe the afterglow evolution, we derive a jet opening angle θj ≈ 5° and a collimation-corrected total energy release E ≈ 2 x 1e50 erg. We further discuss the nature of the GRB progenitor system. Three main lines disfavor a massive star progenitor: the properties of the prompt gamma-ray emission, the age and low star formation rate of the host galaxy, and the lack of a bright supernova. We conclude that this event likely originated from a compact binary merger.

The Rapid infrared IMAger-Spectrometer (RIMAS) is a near-infrared (NIR) imager and spectrometer that will quickly follow up gamma-ray burst afterglows on the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT). RIMAS has two optical arms which allows simultaneous coverage over two bandpasses (YJ and HK) in either imaging or spectroscopy mode. RIMAS utilizes two Teledyne HgCdTe H2RG detectors controlled by Astronomical Research Cameras, Inc. (ARC/Leach) drivers. We report the laboratory characterization of RIMAS's detectors: conversion gain, read noise, linearity, saturation, dynamic range, and dark current. We also present RIMAS's instrument efficiency from atmospheric transmission models and optics data (both telescope and instrument) in all three observing modes.

The Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrograph (RIMAS) is an instrument designed to observe gamma ray burst afterglows following initial detection by the SWIFT satellite. Operating in the near infrared between 0.9 and 2.4 μm, it has capabilities for both low resolution (R ~ 25) and moderate resolution (R ~ 4000) spectroscopy. Two zinc selenide (ZnSe) grisms provide dispersion in the moderate resolution mode: one covers the Y and J bands and the other covers the H and K. Each has a clear aperture of 44 mm. The YJ grism has a blaze angle of 49.9° with a 40 μm groove spacing. The HK grism is blazed at 43.1° with a 50 μm grooves spacing.
Previous fabrication of ZnSe grisms on the Precision Engineering Research Lathe (PERL II) at LLNL has demonstrated the importance of surface preparation, tool and fixture design, tight thermal control, and backup power sources for the machine. The biggest challenges in machining the RIMAS grisms are the large grooved area, which indicates long machining time, and the relatively steep blaze angle, which means that the grism wavefront error is much more sensitive to lathe metrology errors. Mitigating techniques are described.

We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) light curves and optical spectra of SN 2013dx, associated with the nearby (redshift 0.145) gamma-ray burst GRB 130702A. The prompt isotropic gamma-ray energy released from GRB 130702A is measured to be 6.4 +1.3 -1.0 x 1e50 erg (1 keV to 10 MeV in the rest frame), placing it intermediate between low-luminosity GRBs like GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and the broader cosmological population. We compare the observed g'r'i'z' light curves of SN 2013dx to a SN 1998bw template, finding that SN 2013dx evolves ∼20% faster (steeper rise time), with a comparable peak luminosity. Spectroscopically, SN 2013dx resembles other broad-lined SNe Ic, both associated with (SN 2006aj and SN 1998bw) and lacking (SN 1997ef, SN 2007I, and SN 2010ah) gamma-ray emission, with photospheric velocities around peak of ∼ 21,000 km s−1. We construct a quasi-bolometric (g'r'i'z'yJ) light curve for SN 2013dx, only the fifth GRB-associated SN with extensive NIR coverage and the third with a bolometric light curve extending beyond 40 days. Together with the measured photospheric velocity, we derive basic explosion parameters using simple analytic models. We infer a 56Ni mass of 0.37 +- 0.01 Solar masses, an ejecta mass of 3.1 +- 0.1 Solar masses, and a kinetic energy of (8.2 +- 0.43) x 1e51 erg (statistical uncertainties only), consistent with previous GRB-associated supernovae. When considering the ensemble population of GRB-associated supernovae, we find no correlation between the mass of synthesized 56Ni and high-energy properties, despite clear predictions from numerical simulations that Ni mass should correlate with the degree of asymmetry. On the other hand, Ni mass clearly correlates with the kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta across a wide range of core-collapse events.

**Happy Birthday Swift: Ultra-long GRB 141121A and Its Broadband Afterglow**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

We present our extensive observational campaign on the Swift-discovered GRB 141121A, almost 10 years after its launch. Our observations cover radio through X-rays and extend for more than 30 days after discovery. The prompt phase of GRB 141121A lasted 1410 s and, at the derived redshift of z = 1.469, the isotropic energy is Eγ,iso = 8.0 × 1052 erg. Due to the long prompt duration, GRB 141121A falls into the recently discovered class of ultra-long GRBs (UL-GRBs). Peculiar features of this burst are (1) a flat early-time optical light curve and (2) a radio-to-X-ray rebrightening around three days after the burst. The latter is followed by a steep optical-to-X-ray decay and a much shallower radio fading. We analyze GRB 141121A in the context of the standard forward–reverse shock (FS, RS) scenario and we disentangle the FS and RS contributions. Finally, we comment on the puzzling early-time (t ≲ 3 days) behavior of GRB 141121A, and suggest that its interpretation may require a two-component jet model. Overall, our analysis confirms that the class of UL-GRBs represents our best opportunity to firmly establish the prominent emission mechanisms in action during powerful gamma-ray burst explosions, and future missions (like SVOM, XTiDE, or ISS-Lobster) will provide many more of such objects.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>

The Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS) is designed to perform follow-up observations of transient astronomical sources at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths (0.9 - 2.4 microns). In particular, RIMAS will be used to perform photometric and spectroscopic observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows to compliment the Swift satellite’s science goals. Upon completion, RIMAS will be installed on Lowell Observatory’s 4.3 meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) located in Happy Jack, Arizona. The instrument’s optical design includes a collimator lens assembly, a dichroic to divide the wavelength coverage into two optical arms (0.9 - 1.4 microns and 1.4 - 2.4 microns respectively), and a camera lens assembly for each optical arm. Because the wavelength coverage extends out to 2.4 microns, all optical elements are cooled to ~70 K. Filters and transmission gratings are located on wheels prior to each camera allowing the instrument to be quickly configured for photometry or spectroscopy. An athermal optomechanical design is being implemented to prevent lenses from loosing their room temperature alignment as the system is cooled. The thermal expansion of materials used in this design have been measured in the lab. Additionally, RIMAS has a guide camera consisting of four lenses to aid observers in passing light from target sources through spectroscopic slits. Efforts to align these optics are ongoing.

The Observational Cosmology Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), in collaboration with the University of Maryland, is building the Rapid Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (RIMAS) for the new 4.3 meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT). The instrument is designed to observe gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows following their initial detection by the Swift satellite. RIMAS will operate in the near infrared (0.9 – 2.4 microns) with all of its optics cooled to ~60 K. The primary optical design includes a collimator lens assembly, a dichroic dividing the wavelength coverage into the “YJ band” and “HK band” optical arms, and camera lens assemblies for each arm. Additionally, filters and dispersive elements are attached to wheels positioned prior to each arm’s camera, allowing the instrument to quickly change from its imaging modes to spectroscopic modes. Optics have also been designed to image the sky surrounding spectroscopic slits to help observers pass light from target sources through these slits. Because the optical systems are entirely cryogenic, it was necessary to account for changing refractive indices and model the effects of thermal contraction. One result of this work is a lens mount design that keeps lenses centered on the optical axis as the system is cooled. Efforts to design, tolerance and assemble these cryogenic optical systems are presented.
